# Moscow_airport_analytics
Project based on analysis of database that contains information about airplane tickets from Moscow(Rusia) airport.

The database was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/francuzovd/airplane-tickets-from-moscow-2022, where the dataset of tickets purchased by passengers for flights departing from the city of Moscow - Russia to different cities around the world, we also have the datasets of the airlines and the different airports around the worldcfrom IATA, which allows us to relate the different datasets with each other to respond to each of the requests for information of the project.

We present the solution to data analysis requirements through python using libraries like pandas, matplotlib, numpy, plotly, math, plotty-dash, etc. This, as a response to a final project of the Machine Learning course offered in alliance of SAPIENCIA and University of Antioquia.
